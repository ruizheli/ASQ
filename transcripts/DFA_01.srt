This video we're going to work at complete problem of converting a regular session to a DFA we're going to start by writing down the regular expression

2
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:15,360
Turning out to an NFA and then converting that to a DFA so the problem we're going to work is

3
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:20,736
X followed by X or Y

4
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:28,672
Star War Z so some strings it would be accepted by that would be just

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:36,864
Just as I myself or just acts by itself or Acts

6
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:44,800
How about a x/y x would be okay xyy

7
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:47,872
Basically X4 by any combination of x
